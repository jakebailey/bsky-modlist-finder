# bsky-modlist-finder

[Click here.](https://jakebailey.dev/bsky-modlist-finder)

Uses the Clearsky and Bluesky APIs to find modlists for a given user, sorted by
the authors' follower count.

(Really only useful until Clearsky adds something like this themselves.)

## Design

I typically use side projects like this to experiment with stuff I haven't used
before; this time, it's SolidJS(https://www.solidjs.com/) and
[Effect](https://effect.website/).
